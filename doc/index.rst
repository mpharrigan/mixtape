    Statistical models for Biomolecular Dynamics</h2>

MSMBuilder is an application and python library. It builds
statistical models for high-dimensional time-series. The particular focus
of the package is on the analysis of atomistic simulations of biomolecular
dynamics such as protein folding and conformational change.

To get started via `Anaconda Python <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_,
use::

    conda install -c omnia msmbuilder


MSMBuilder is developed by primarily by researchers at Stanford University,
and we welcome contributions. The development all takes place on `Github
<https://github.com/msmbuilder/msmbuilder>`_.  MSMBuilder is licensed under
the GNU LGPL (v2.1 or later).
